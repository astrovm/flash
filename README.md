# Astro Flash Collection

**Classic games and Windows XP apps, right in your browser.**

A Windows XP-style desktop that runs in your browser. Play classic games and use selected original Windows XP applications without installing anything.

## 🚀 Use

- Open [flash.4st.li](https://flash.4st.li/). There's nothing to install.
- Want a game offline? Open an included game once, or download it in **Settings → Games**.

## Features

- **XP shell.** Explorer, Paint, Notepad, Pinball, themes, and settings.
- **Original XP apps.** Such as Calculator and the card games.
- **Real windows.** Drag game windows around, switch tasks, go fullscreen, and set the volume.
- **Find games fast.** Favorites, recently played, categories, search, and deep links.
- **Offline play.** With optional downloads for individual games.
- **Internet Games.** A catalog backed by Flashpoint Archive.

## Offline and updates

- **The shell is cached automatically.** The XP desktop works offline without doing anything.
- **Included games cache themselves.** Opening one starts a background download so it works offline next time.
- **Manage downloads.** **Settings → Games** downloads or removes games one at a time or all together.
- **Runtimes load on demand.** The shared Ruffle and ScummVM runtimes download only when a game needs them.
- **Updates don't interrupt you.** They install in the background and leave the current page alone.
- **Switching versions.** Reopen the site to get the new version, or press **Update Now** to reload right away.
- **Internet Games are stored separately.** They live in IndexedDB and Cache Storage.
- **GameZIP titles install completely.** Legacy titles cache extra files as the game requests them.

Installing Internet Games needs a browser with IndexedDB, OPFS, and streaming responses.

## Your files

- **Each document is saved on its own.** Documents are separate IndexedDB records.
- **Old files come along.** Older localStorage files migrate automatically in a single transaction, and the old snapshot is kept as a recovery backup.
- **Saves are real saves.** A save finishes only after the database commits it.
- **Multiple tabs are safe.** Any tab can write, but if another tab changed the same file first, the save is rejected so the editor keeps its draft.

<summary><b>Getting started (development)</b></summary>

Install the Bun version pinned in `package.json`. CI reads the same pin.

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

The development server:

- builds the site into `dist/`
- watches the build inputs and rebuilds on change
- reloads open tabs after each successful build
- serves the local `/api/games` proxy that Internet Games uses
- starts immediately when `dist/` is already current

| Flag        | What it does                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--rebuild` | Forces a fresh build             |
| `--no-sync` | Serves the existing output as is |

```bash
bun run dev -- --rebuild
```

### Testing offline updates

```bash
bun run preview
```

Preview serves the real production service worker and gives every rebuild a new local version. It does not reload the page for you. Use **Astro Flash Settings** → **Updates** → **Check Now** to walk through the update flow.

### XP reference VM

```bash
bun run xp:vm --instance <name>
```

This starts an isolated Windows XP VM to compare against. Changes are discarded when it stops, so several sessions can share one base disk. Pass `--write-base` only when a change must be saved to that disk.

By default the VM uses the Cirrus adapter of the original reference captures, up to 1280×1024. Pass `--vga std` for 1920×1080 at 32-bit color. That mode uses the free [VBEMP](http://bearwindows.zcm.com.au/vbemp.htm) display driver (`vbempk.zip`, VBE20/XP/PNP), installed in the base disk. It is the only software in the VM that isn't from the XP SP3 ISO.

The VM has an AC97 sound card, with Intel's driver from the XP ISO installed in the base disk, so the tray **Volume** icon and **Volume Control** work. It plays into a silent backend; `--audio-output <file.wav>` records it instead, and `--sound none` removes it.

The VM has no network adapter. Pass `--nic user,model=rtl8139,restrict=on` for one with no Internet access, for pages such as Task Manager's **Networking**.

Type commands into the VM's terminal, or send them from another shell. Each `send` waits for its command to finish:

```bash
bun tools/xp-vm.ts send until 960 1062 225ad9 240000  # wait for the 1920x1080 taskbar
bun tools/xp-vm.ts send chord ctrl shift esc
bun tools/xp-vm.ts send wait                          # until the screen settles
bun tools/xp-vm.ts send click 120 76                  # in screen pixels
bun tools/xp-vm.ts send screenshot /tmp/xp.png
```

`send` finds the running VM on its own; pass `--instance <name>` when several are running. Run `help` for every command.

The [fidelity roadmap](docs/XP-FIDELITY-ROADMAP.md) lists known taskbar gaps, finished reference passes, and the remaining areas in priority order.

<summary><b>Checks</b></summary>

Run these before pushing:

| Command                 | What it runs                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `bun run quality`       | Prettier and ESLint                    |
| `bun run test`          | typecheck, tests, and asset validation |
| `bun run test:coverage` | tests with first-party coverage        |

Typechecking uses the native TypeScript 7 compiler from `@typescript/native`. TypeScript 6 stays installed because TypeScript ESLint still needs it.

Tests run in 4 parallel worker processes. More workers barely speed them up and slow down the rest of the computer. Each test file groups its tests under a `describe` that names the subject, and each test name is a lowercase, present-tense behavior that reads as a sentence after it, for example `Flash URL router` › `rejects ambiguous and unsafe routes`. Shell tests move XP timers forward with `shell.advanceTime(ms)` from `tests/helpers/shell-harness.ts` instead of waiting in real time.

`bun run test:coverage` instruments first-party code with Istanbul, including the classic scripts the shell harness loads into Happy DOM. It writes an HTML report to `coverage/index.html` and fails unless lines, statements, functions, and branches are all at 100%. Instrumentation slows the suite, so this run allows each test 30 seconds. CI enforces the same threshold on every pull request.

<summary><b>Games and applications</b></summary>

Catalog games live in `site/js/games.js`.

| Game kind                                         | `type`     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Ruffle                                            | `"swf"`    |
| Embedded HTML5, js-dos, ScummVM, reVCDOS, and re3 | `"iframe"` |

XP applications are web-native rebuilds, one folder each in `site/apps/` and registered in `site/apps/index.js`. Windows XP Pinball runs its MIT Space Cadet WebAssembly build from `site/apps/pinball/`.

<summary><b>How Internet Games installs work</b></summary>

Installing a game streams the download into a temporary file in the browser's private filesystem (OPFS), validates the ZIP index, and extracts one file at a time into Cache Storage. Reads are bounded, and sizes and CRCs are checked. If the install is cancelled or fails, partial cache entries and the temporary archive are removed. This needs a browser with IndexedDB, OPFS, and streaming responses.

<summary><b>Deployment</b></summary>

Pull requests run formatting, lint, tests, the coverage check, and a production build. The protected `main` branch requires passing PR checks. Pushes to `main` build, deploy and smoke-test the Cloudflare Worker, and then publish the site to GitHub Pages.

CI needs these GitHub Actions secrets:

| Secret                  | Value                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account ID                                                                                 |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`  | Token with **Workers Scripts: Edit** on the account and **Workers Routes: Edit** on the `4st.li` zone |

To deploy the Worker by hand:

```bash
bun run deploy:worker
```

<summary><b>Contributing</b></summary>

Before opening a pull request:

- Check game compatibility, controls, frame rate, and category.
- Make sure `bun run quality`, `bun run test`, and `bun run test:coverage` all pass.
