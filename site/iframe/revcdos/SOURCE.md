The browser runtime, page, modules, and package manifest are vendored from that
Lolendor commit. Original-game media from the upstream distribution is not
bundled. Astro Flash does not bundle the compatible game-data package.

Files selected or downloaded by the user are streamed once into a single
indexed OPFS file. The offline service worker serves slices of that file through
same-origin HTTP-like requests, including byte ranges. The upstream
135,355,111-byte preload and remaining runtime assets therefore use normal
`fetch()`/XHR paths without per-file parent-frame messages. After a torrent is
packed successfully, its peer connections and piece store are destroyed.

The upstream MIT license is stored in `LOLENDOR-LICENSE`.

Automatic downloads use the torrent metadata published by DOS.Zone at
`https://br.cdn.dos.zone/launcher/revcdoseng.2.torrent` (info hash
`489dae72cb4433fadd7d38a12bb52a23b5a7cc1e`). The torrent metadata contains file
names, hashes, and tracker addresses, but not the game data itself.

The browser downloader is WebTorrent 3.0.21 from the `webtorrent` npm package.
The build copies its browser bundle into `vendor/webtorrent/3.0.21/`.

The DOS.Zone Team attribution, in-game logo, and `jsdos-cloud-sdk.js` cloud-save
integration required by the upstream project are preserved.
